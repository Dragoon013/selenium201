                  <h3>The Training Environment</h3>

                  <ul>
                    <li>ReadyTech virtual machines</li>
                    <li>Eclipse</li>
                    <li>Maven</li>
                  </ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>So before we go into the different parts we need to incldue in a script, let's talk about our training environment.</p>
                    <p>First off, we'll be working in a VM provided by ReadyTech today. If you have any problems during the course of labs, I will be able to go into your instance and help you out. You can just notify me using the ReadyTech instance to tell me that you need help.</p>
                    <p>We're also going to be working in Eclipse today. In Eclipse, we have set up the scripts within a framework called TestNG, for Java, that allows us to run the scripts with all of the dependencies it needs very easily.</p>
                    <p>That within that framework, there is a library, or build tool, called Maven that we are using to grab our dependencies, bundle them together, and then run our script.</p>
                    <p>Normally, we would have to run a long command that looks like:</p>
                    <pre><code class="java" data-trim contenteditable>
                        javac -cp ".:./selenium-2.53.0/selenium-java-2.53.0.jar:./selenium-2.53.0/libs/*" SampleSauceTest.java
                        java -cp ".:./selenium-2.53.0/selenium-java-2.53.0.jar:./selenium-2.53.0/libs/*" SampleSauceTest
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>The first line compiles the code with all of the requisite libraries and jars it needs, and then the second line runs it.</p>
                    <p>Maven will do all of that for us, so we don't need to run an additional script to start the test script, or have to include the libraries manually in a command.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the course today, the way we will run our tests is by using the "Maven test" command, which should compile all of our resources and dependencies together, and run it for us.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, for those of you who may not have used Eclipse before, when you type in a line that does not have the right syntax, it will generally underline the offending line or part of the line that you need to fix, in red. If you simply hover or select that part of the line, Ecplise will give you suggestions on how to fix the problem.</p>

				  <h3>What is Sauce Labs?</h3>
                  <p>Testing infrastructure in the cloud for web and mobile web applications.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Web Automated Testing</li>
                  <li>Mobile Automated Testing</li>

                    <p>So what is this Sauce Labs? They describe themselves as providers and supporters of Web Automated and Mobile Automated testing.</p>
                      <p>They support two very large open source projects, namely Selenium and Appium. Selenium is used for Desktop and mobile browser testing, while appium is used for native and hybrid application testing.</p>
                      <p>Sauce Labs provides environments that run your Selenium or Appium tests on any browser and OS combination you like - and they have over 500 combinations thereof. (if you include the different browser versions)</p>

                      <p>
                        Sauce Labs was founded in 2008 by Jason Huggins, co-creator of Selenium (the open source standard for automated testing frameworks) and Steve Hazel, current CTO. They set out to create a cloud-based platform for automated testing to free development teams from the hassle and cost of testing so they can focus on innovating their core capabilities.
                      </p>
                      <p>In an interview, Jason said the inspiration for starting Sauce labs came when he was working as a QA consultant. He was using Selenium to do browser testing, and the process of testing the apps in different browsers was taking too long. The problem was that all the testing was being done on one machine, so he split the tests onto 4 different machines, effectively running the tests in parallel, which cut the time drastically. Which is precisely what Sauce Labs does today.</p>

					<h3>CI/CD Cycle</h3>

                    <img src="assets/images/sauceCI2.png" style="border:0; text-align:center; background:none;">
                    <p style="text-align:center;">Continuous Integration/Continuous Development</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>Sauce Labs' value as a time saver is apparent even in its role in Continuous Integration and Delivery. </p>
                      <p>Traditionally, testing and QA are bottlenecks for application delivery and release. Writing automated tests, maintaining testing infrastructure, painful manual testing, all consume huge amounts of time. The work is never done either, because the product is always changing.</p>
                      <p>Sauce Labs takes away those worries though. With Selenium and Appium testing, we remove the barrier of time consuming test writing, and with Sauce Labs itself, we remove the need to have a propietary infrastructure. Sauce Labs provides the infrastructure for you, allowing you to test on a variety of platforms in a speedy manner. So you can focus on development, and releases, and leave the testing to Sauce Labs.</p>
                      <p>Sauce Labs reduces the pain of testing, so that instead of traditionally waiting until the end of the development life cycle to test, you can test iteratively, as you go through each step of development.</p>

				  <h3>What is Selenium?</h3>
                  <p>Developed in 2004 by Jason Huggins at ThoughtWorks.</p>
				  <p>Browser automation framework used for testing.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Simulate site interaction</li>
                    <li>Automate Application Testing</li>
                  </ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Selenium was developed in 2004 as an internal tool at ThoughtWorks, by Jason Huggins. It's an open source product that has gone through a couple stages of evolution at this point, with numerous other contributors, but it has always facilitated and simplified application testing.(Hammant, Simon Stewart, etc)</p>
                    <p>So <b>how</b> does Sauce Labs faciltate your testing? Selenium is the core testing framework that Sauce Labs runs for you on a variety of Browser and OS combinations.</p>
                    <p>Selenium is the testing framework that provides the actual language and ability to test interations on a browser. We use its API to write scripts in our preferred language, and then the commands in those scripts simulate interaction on a browser, either locally on your own computer, or remotely.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    So where do I actually run my selenium scripts? Well you can always run it locally; when you run a script, it pulls up a browser that's on your machine, accesses your application, and runs the test. But then you're restricted to the OS that is actually on your machine, as well as the browser versions and types that are available for that OS as well. It would be difficult to run IE on Ubuntu!
                    <p>In order to test across browsers or OS's, Selenium offers the Selenium Server. The Selenium server can help you create a Selenium farm; that is, a server farm that has VMs running with many different possible OS and browser combinations.</p>
                    <p>But that's pretty painful and time consuming to set up and manage, not to even mention the cost of hardware.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs handles all of that stuff for you. They run a Selenium Grid themselves and rent it out to their customers to run their Selenium and Appium tests on. </p>

                    <p>If tbe Selenium grid itself isn't enough, Sauce Labs provides a whole slew of other additional features, such as security, recorded tests and integration with other tools. Sauce Labs provides security through it's Sauce Connect technology, which allows you to run tests on your localhost applications. It sends your Selenium or appium commands through a proxy server, ensuring that your information is protected.</p>
                    <p>Seamless integration refers the multitude of pltforms that Sauce integrates with, such as Jenkins, Bamboo, JIRA, and more.</p>
                    <p>And each test you run is recorded by default. This includes screenshots, a video recording of the entire test, as well as log files.</p>

                    <p>Let's go ahead and take a look at Sauce Labs right now.</p>
                    <li>Dashboard: On the dashboard, there are 3 different tabs. These help organize the kinds of tests that we run on Sauce Labs.</li>
                    <p>We have a tab for tests that are run and labelled as builds, one for our automated tests, and one for manual tests.</p>
                    <li>Tunnels: The tunnels tab will list out all of secure tunnels that are currently enabled and running between Sauce Labs and your local machine.</li>
                    <li>Account Details: Lastly, our account details page is important. You can see your VM usage, as well as find your access key, which is required for authentication when using Sauce Labs. We'll go into how to use it later on.</li>

                  <h3>Manual Testing</h3>
                  <p>The traditional method of testing applications and sites</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Testing Locally</li>
                    <li>Sauce Labs Manual Tests</li>
                  </ul>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Traditionally, testing was done manually, with a user just going into the application and manually clicking on elements and making sure the application didn't break.</p>
                    <p> Sauce Labs allows you to do manual tests, whether you use it to actually test your product, or to plan out what sort of tests you are going to run on your site. With the manual testing, you still get some of the great features that you get with the automated tests as well, such as the video recording, screenshots captured, and logs. </p>
                    <p>Demo a manual test:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Log into <a href="http://saucelabs.com" target="_blank">saucelabs.com</a>.</li>

                    <p>There are actually a lot of parts that make up Selenium!</p>

                    <li>Selenium IDE: A firefox add-on that can create a script from a manual test, allow you to do maual testing, and debug your own test scripts.</li>
                    <li>Selenium Client API: What we will be using today, as part of the Selenium Webdriver. It allows tests to be written in a variety of programming languages, so it enables us to write our tests in Java. These are the language specific bindings.</li>
                    <li>Selenium WebDriver: The client that accepts the commands via the API or in the Selenium scripting language and sends those commands to a browser.</li>
                    <li>Selenium Grid: This is the Selenium Server, which allows tests to to use web browsers on other machines. This is what Sauce Labs does for you, but on a very large scale and with a lot of options for machines and browsers - not restricted to just one version either.</li>

				  <h3>How Selenium WebDriver Works</h3>
                  <p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Write script</li>
                      <li>Run script (send commands via API)</li>
                      <li>WebDriver Client sends commands to browser</li>
                      <li>WebDriver Client sends results back</li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>The only difference between how Selenium works locally or remotely is where the browser is opened to exceute the commands. Locally, the driver will just open a brwoser based off of the type driver used in the script. Remotely, in particular on Sauce Labs, the remote webdriver is used to pass the script commands along to a remote browser, whose type is set through additional commands. With Sauce Labs, you'll have the additional step of the test asset creation at the end. These are the videos, screenshots, and logs that recorded your test.</p>

				    <h3>5. Anticipate Browser Response</h3>

                    <p>Implicit Waits</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A blanket wait time that applies to each findElement search (findElement(By.id())).</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Explicit Waits</p>
                      <ul><li>A wait time set until a condition of an element (such as "selected" or "visible") becomes true.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>Tests might fail because the elements that are expected for the next step haven't loaded into the browser yet. It's good to have an explicit wait time in this case, as after a click, it can be variable how long it takes for an element to be loaded.</p>
                      <p>For example, when we click on that drop-down that has an ID of ham, it takes time for the options on the drop down to render. We would need to set a wait in order for the action on the drop down to succeed.</p>
                      <p>While we may not have waits in our current script, we will take a look at them in a later module.</p>

                       <p> When running tests on both Sauce Labs and Locally, recording test results need extra configuration. By default, you will be able to see when a test is complete, or has "failed". But without specific test results sent back to Sauce Labs or custom made locally, you have no way of knowing whether a complete means a test was successful, or whether a failure means the test failed or if the test wasn't written correctly.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                         Test frameworks can help us report our results back to Sauce Labs (and on your own Selenium Grid). Through the Sauce Labs UI, we get some core reporting/recording of test results through their screenshots, screencast of the test, and logs.

                      <p>Another method we have is the CSS selector, which captures the path to the html element through the CSS path and definition.</p>
                      <p>For those of you who are not familiar with XPATH, it is the language used to locate nodes in an XML doc. HTML can be an implementation of XHTML (XML), so you can use XPATH to locate elements on a page. Most people use the XPATH to locate an element because the element may not have an ID or name attribute to locate it easily.
                      </p>
                      <p>The danger in using XPATH and the CSS selector lies in how it finds elements, which is essentially <b>where</b> the element is in the hierarchy of the page. If that element moves during the development of the application, then your tests are at risk of breaking, if they XPATH. It's generally recommended to not use XPATHs unless you don't have any other choice.</p>

                      <p>For short simple test scripts, finding an element and performning an action on it right away may be the best course of action.</p>

                      <p>Another reason we might want to store the element in an object, is to improve the script speed and latency. If we're making a bunch of queries to get the same object multiple times, that's the time it takes to send a command and the time it takes to recieve a response.</p>
                      <p>In both of these examples, we are simply finding the link id'd by "I am a link", and clicking on it.</p>

                    <p>One thing to consider when setting up your testing environment or suite, is to use Environment Variables for your credentials or explicitly state them in your script.</p>
                    <p>Having environment variables with your credentials makes tests more re-usable among other team members. For example, they may be using their own credentials to log in and it doesn't run the risk of potential exposure of credentials.</p>

                    There are many situations in which your test script may run ahead of the website or application you're testing, resulting in timeouts and a failing test. For example, you may have a dynamic content element that, after a user clicks on it, a loading appears for five seconds. If your script isn't written in such a way as to account for that five second load time, it may fail because the next interactive element isn't available yet. The general recommended solution for this is to use explicit waits.

                  <p></p>
                  <p>A test automation framework is a scaffold comprised of libraries, dependecies, drivers, and helper scripts that facilitate the execution of Selenium test scripts.</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Ok, what does that mean? It's essentially just a bunch of additional libraries we can use in conjunction with our script for several cases:</p>
                    <li>Record your data: Frameworks often have, or can have a way for you to output the results of your test scripts for you, rather than writing them by hand</li>
                    <li>Talk to external applications: you can include external libraries in your framework to talk to and send results to places like Sauce Labs</li>

                  <h3>Test Driven Development vs. Behavior Driven Development</h3>
                  <p>TDD: A developer writes the test, and then writes code, and tests that code continuously, until the test passes.</p>
                  <p>BDD: A way to plan and develop code similar to TDD, but allows teams to include non-technical members when writing tests for scenarios and features</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>In the QA/Test industry, there are a couple of different ways of thinking about how to develop applications with testing in mind. One of those is TDD, where you write a test, and then write the code until the test passes. Antoher variant is to plan the same kind of testing, but on a higher level, basically written in a more colloquial manner though.</p>
                    <p>TDD is also somewhat synonymous with "test first" development. BDD means writing tests that read like a book, almost in full sentences, so teams can understand precisely what a test is trying to accomplish.</p>

                  <h3>TDD Planning Example</h3>
                  <p>Sauce_counter() needs to count the number of sauces inputted</p>
                  <p>Pasta_counter() needs to count the number of pastas inputted</p>
                  <p>sNpComparer() needs to compare the counts and make sure that they are equal</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of TDD, because we have idenfitfied features of the program that need to be made, and we have a function for each one, which details very explicity what each will do.</p>
                  </aside>
                </section>


                <section>
                  <h3>BDD Planning Example</h3>

                  <p>Feature: Pasta and Sauce Matchmaker</p>
                  <p>Scenario: Some sauces</p>
                  <ul><p>Given I have 5 different kinds of Sauce</p>
                  <p>When I have 5 different kinds of Pasta</p>
                  <p>Then my chef will be happy</p></ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of BDD, which uses the Given, When, Then, method of planning. It details the actual goals of what the application or feature needs to accomplishes, in terms of a user story, rather than explicit functions. In this method of planning, we are making sure that the end goal or the business objective will be accomplished.</p>

                      <p>A common element of Selenium scripts are Asserts. Asserts come with whichever testing framwork that you have decided to work with. They generally check whether a particular value is true or not. For example, if the uncheckedboxed state returns true, then that means the assert will pass. It's basically the test itself. If an assert fails, that generally means the test has failed as well. We're going to try using asserts ourselves.</p>

                     <h3>Small, Atomic, and Autonomous Testing</h3>
                     <p>Small: Tests should be short and succinct</p>
                     <p>Atomic: Tests should focus on testing a single feature.</p>
                     <p>Autonomous: Tests should be independent of other tests.</p>

                     <aside class="notes">

                       <p>Short - If you have a test suite of 100 tests running concurrently on 100 VMs, then the time it will take to run the entire suite will be determined by the longest/slowest test case. Keeping your tests small ensures that your suite will run efficiently and provide you with results faster. </p>
                       <p>Atomic - The test makes clear exactly what it is that you're testing. If the test fails, then you should also have a very clear idea of what needs to be fixed. </p>
                       <p>Autonomous - Tests should not be dependent on the results of one test to run successfully. In addition, an autonomous test should use its own data to test against, and not create potential conflicts with other tests over the same data.  </p>

                       <p>Performance testing serves to answer questions such as, can your application server handle a particular load, and does it behave as expected when you push it to its limit? These types of tests are better undertaken with a testing infrastructure that has been specifically developed for performance testing, so all baseline performance metrics are well established and understood before you start the test.</p>

                     <p>Avoid dependencies between tests</p>
                     <ul><li>If you chain tests together, when one at the top fails, then they will all fail</li></ul>
                     <p>Use Frameworks</p>
                     <ul><li>Frameworks include helpful libraries and functionality that can help you make the most of parallelization</li></ul>

                       <p>Running tests in parallel is the secret Sauce for accelerating your development process and creating a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline.</p>
                       <p>One of the main features that Sauce Labs offers is parallelization, the ability to run serveral scripts at once on a variety of platforms. Since tests and commands are sent remotely, these tests take longer to run individually, but with parallelization, we can run them all at once. That is, we can start them all at the same time, which cuts down on the total time tests would normally take, saving time and money for your teams and business.</p>
                       <p>It's good to avoid dependencies between tests. This goes along with the atomic testing strategy, where we want to create autonomous tests, so that they don't depend on each other, and when one fails, then we know exactly what failed.</p>
